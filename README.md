# Projekt Zespolowy Tetris Over LAN
This is a PC application that allows two players to play together on the same LAN.
The connection to the LAN will be made using the Java Server Socket feature. The first player is responsible for creating a server on the local network and the second player will connect to it. 
The game starts when the two players click "play".
